# Live incident response

Read this when a production system is currently broken, degraded, or suspected compromised — before the postmortem, while the fire is burning.

<!-- Distilled from meirwah/awesome-incident-response, OTRF/ThreatHunter-Playbook (hypothesis-driven hunts), Cugu/awesome-forensics (evidence preservation), and Google SRE incident practice. -->

- Preserve before you remediate. A restart destroys the state that explains the outage: capture logs, a heap/thread dump, process and connection state, queue depths, and the current config *first*. Five seconds of capture buys the root cause; skipping it usually costs a second incident.
- Suspected compromise changes the order: isolate the host or rotate the credential before anything else, and do not power-cycle — memory is where the evidence lives.
- Contain, then fix. Stop the bleeding (disable the feature flag, drain the node, revoke the token) before diagnosing. A mitigation that is not a fix is still the right first move.
- One case record per incident with a running timestamped timeline — what was observed, what was changed, by whom. A chat thread is not a record; copy decisions into the case as they happen.
- Every change during an incident is announced and reversible, one at a time. Two simultaneous fixes make the eventual explanation unprovable.
- Classify severity at declaration and let the class drive the response: full outage or data loss pages everyone now; partial degradation pages the owning team; a cosmetic defect waits for morning. Classifying down to avoid noise delays the help the incident needs.
- One person coordinates and does not debug: the incident commander assigns work, tracks the timeline, and decides escalation — the moment the coordinator dives into a shell, nobody is watching the whole board. Hand the role off explicitly when they must.
- Communicate on a fixed cadence to one known place — a status update at an agreed interval even when the update is "no change". Silence reads as abandonment and generates the interruptions that stall the fix.
- Set the escalation trigger in advance and honor it: two failed mitigations, or a defined period with no new hypothesis, pulls in the next tier or the vendor. "Almost have it" is the phrase that turns a one-hour incident into a six-hour one.
- Match the evidence to the action before running it (core rule): a symptom that pattern-matches a known failure may have a different cause today. Say which signal justifies the restart, the rollback, or the scale-up.
- Rotate any credential that was exposed, printed, or possibly read during the incident — including ones you only suspect (`rules/crypto.md`).
- Redact diagnostics before sharing: tokens, proxy URLs, and internal hostnames become placeholders in any output pasted to a channel, ticket, or vendor — diagnostic tools print them freely, and an incident channel is the most-read document in the company that week. Disabling TLS verification is never a fix, not even temporarily.
- The postmortem records the hypotheses that were ruled out and the evidence that ruled them out, not only the final cause. A reader who cannot see what was eliminated cannot trust the conclusion, and repeats the search next time.
- Close the loop with something executable: a regression test that fails on the old code, or an alert that would have fired earlier — and prove the new alert fires against the recorded incident data before trusting it (`rules/testing.md`, `rules/observability.md`).
- Blameless: findings name systems, defaults, and missing guardrails — never a person. "The deploy path allowed an unreviewed config change" is actionable; "X pushed bad config" is not.
