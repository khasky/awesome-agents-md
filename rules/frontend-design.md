# Frontend design and UI craft

Read this when building, styling, or reviewing web UI: pages, components, dashboards. The craft and accessibility numbers hold for any UI; the CSS and DOM APIs are web-only.

<!-- Distilled from vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines, nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill, anthropics/skills frontend-design, Anthropic's Opus 5.5 prompting guide (frontend design defaults), and khasky/marketing-and-seo-playbook (permission prompts, layout reservation). -->

## Numbers agents get wrong

- Contrast: 4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text and UI components against adjacent colors. Test dark mode separately — desaturated tonal variants, never inverted colors.
- Touch targets ≥44×44px with ≥8px gaps; extend the hit area beyond a smaller visual icon.
- Body text ≥16px (avoids iOS auto-zoom), line-height ~1.5, 65–75 characters per line.
- Spacing on a 4/8px scale; z-index from a defined scale (0/10/20/40/100); no arbitrary values.
- Motion: 150–300ms micro-interactions, ≤400ms transitions; ease-out on enter, ease-in on exit (exit ~70% of enter); stagger lists 30–50ms per item; animate `transform`/`opacity` by default (exceptions: the cost ladder under Animation performance); honor `prefers-reduced-motion`; animations interruptible, never input-blocking; no `transition: all`.
- Icons: SVG from one family with one stroke width (e.g. Lucide, Heroicons) — never emoji; don't mix filled and outline at the same hierarchy level.
- `tabular-nums` for numbers in columns (prices, timers, data).

## Interaction correctness

- When a design system exists, use its tokens and components — no hardcoded hex/pixel values, no ad-hoc restyling; flag deviations instead of silently inventing them.
- `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation — never `<div onClick>`; icon-only buttons need `aria-label`; semantic HTML before ARIA.
- Never remove focus outline without a `:focus-visible` replacement. No `tabindex` greater than 0.
- Core task completable in ≤3 interactions; one primary action per view — no competing primary buttons.
- Dialogs: trap focus inside, set initial focus, Escape closes, focus returns to the trigger on close.
- Link field errors to inputs with `aria-describedby` + `aria-invalid`; toasts are never the only notification (pair with `aria-live`).
- `dvh` over `vh` for full-height layouts.
- Forms: never block paste; correct `type`/`inputmode` per field; labels clickable; validate on blur, not keystroke; errors inline naming the fix, focus the first invalid field; submit stays enabled until the request starts, then shows progress; warn before navigating away with unsaved changes.
- Destructive actions need confirm or undo — never immediate.
- URL reflects state: filters, tabs, pagination deep-linkable; back restores scroll and state.
- Content resilience: design for short, average, and very long content; handle overflow with the CSS properties (`text-overflow`, `line-clamp`, `overflow-wrap`); flex children need `min-width: 0`; handle empty states.
- Images get explicit width/height; reserve layout space for any injected UI (banners, consent bars, embeds) — nothing shifts content when it loads. Lazy-load below the fold; virtualize lists >50 items.
- Never trigger browser permission prompts (notifications, geolocation) on page load — request after a user action that shows the value.
- Locale: `Intl.DateTimeFormat`/`Intl.NumberFormat`, never hand-formatted dates/numbers.
- Copy: active voice; specific button labels ("Save API key", not "Continue"); error messages state the fix.
- A persisted preference (theme, locale, density) is applied before the first paint, through a blocking inline read in the document head or a server render from a cookie. Applied after the app starts, it paints the default first and flashes to the real value; a transition on the themed properties animates the same flash.
- When a feature is explorable before signup and only saving is gated, keep what the visitor built (draft, input, selections) across the signup and attach it to the new account; a signup that discards it turns the wall into the exit.
- Back the numeric rules with an automated accessibility check in the test suite so they hold on the next edit. Automated rules catch only part of the issues, so keyboard and screen-reader passes stay manual.
- Flag on sight: `user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1`, paste blocking, unlabeled icon buttons, images without dimensions, `outline: none`.

## Microcopy

Applies to every user-visible string a product ships: page copy, headings, button labels, `title`/`description`, `alt` text, and the plain-text twin of any structured data. Prose documentation has its own register in `rules/markdown.md`.

- Digits for anything countable and checkable — items, permissions, steps, seconds, clicks, storefronts, years, questions — including 0 through 9 and at the start of a sentence. Digits survive scanning; a spelled number dissolves into the words around it ([NN/g eyetracking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-show-numbers-as-numerals/)). Words stay for `one` as a pronoun or idiom ("one person, one vote", "which one", "one-time code"), for a bare pronoun pair ("the two agree"), and for vague scale ("a thousand throwaway profiles").
- Never mix the two forms in one sentence. "600 emoji, not six defaults" is the bug: recast the sentence, or keep both as words when a rhetorical `one` sits next to the count. Thousands take a comma (`50,000`), a compound modifier takes a hyphen (`6-digit code`), comparison tables always take digits, and a count that also lives in data is interpolated from it rather than typed — the hardcoded copy is the one that goes stale.
- One pair of em-dashes per sentence, never two: an aside inside an aside is where a sentence stops being readable. Recast the second — a colon when a list follows a noun, parentheses for a short qualifier, its own sentence when the aside carries a verb. Adjacent table cells, list items and a `title`/`description` pair are separate sentences, each with its own budget.
- One term per concept, and the internal name is never the user-facing one. Pick the word the interface itself shows the user and use it everywhere; where a product surface quotes a control's exact label, quote it verbatim and mark it as a label rather than paraphrasing. A field name, a feature flag or a class name leaking into copy reads as an implementation detail because it is one.
- Both halves of a string pair change together: the visible HTML and the plain text that feeds structured data, the label and its `aria-label`, the heading and the `title`. Editing one leaves the other contradicting it in the exact place nobody rereads.

## Animation performance

- Cost ladder: composite (`transform`/`opacity`) < paint (color/shadow/filter) < layout (size/position). Pick the cheapest that matches the intent; animate paint/layout only on small isolated surfaces.
- Never interleave layout reads and writes in the same frame: measure once, then animate via transform (FLIP); batch reads before writes.
- Don't drive animation from scroll events or `scrollTop` — use Scroll/View Timelines or IntersectionObserver; pause animations off-screen; no rAF loops without a stop condition.
- `will-change` is temporary and surgical — never applied outside an active animation. Don't animate CSS variables.
- Blur ≤8px, one-shot, never continuous or on large surfaces. View transitions for navigation-level changes only.
- Never migrate or mix animation libraries unless asked.

## Review output

When reviewing UI against these rules, use the comment format from `rules/code-review.md` (`file:line: <severity>: problem. fix.`); "✓ pass" when clean. Each finding names the violated rule and proof it applies to that surface; try to falsify each before reporting; order by impact.
