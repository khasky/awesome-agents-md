## The bar for a new rule

One question decides admission and retention: **would an agent get this wrong without the line?**

- Yes → it belongs.
- No, a competent agent already does it → it does not, however true it is. A rule nobody needed spends attention that the rules below it needed.

The same test prunes. When a model generation stops making a mistake, the line that prevented it becomes a deletion candidate.

Some lines exist only to compensate for a model weakness: push harder to use a tool, keep going instead of stopping early, verify again before claiming done. They cost the most when the weakness is gone, because a newer model over-applies them: an instruction to be thorough turns into over-triggering, and a carried-over verification instruction into over-verification that adds tokens and latency. Re-test these lines against each new model generation the ruleset supports, and cut or narrow the ones the model no longer needs. The ruleset serves several agents at once, so a line stays while any supported model still needs it.

## Where a rule goes

`AGENTS.md` is the always-loaded core and carries two caps, both enforced by `scripts/lint.py`:

- **200 instruction lines** above the module index. Frontier models follow roughly 150–200 instructions reliably ([IFScale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11538)), the agent's own system prompt already spends some of them, and Claude Code's guidance targets the same figure per file.
- **32 KiB for the whole file**, index included. Codex reads at most 32 KiB of project instructions by default and silently truncates the rest ([Codex AGENTS.md docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md)), so anything past that byte never reaches it. The gate counts the file with CRLF line endings, the size a Windows checkout reads. Leave headroom: a project's own `AGENTS.md` shares the same budget.

Adding to the core means removing from the core. A long line counts once toward the line cap and in full toward the byte cap, so moving words into fewer lines saves nothing.

Everything conditional goes to `rules/` — a module is read only when the task matches, so it costs nothing until it is needed. A new module needs:

1. The file, `rules/<topic>.md`.
2. One entry in the **On-demand rule modules** list at the end of `AGENTS.md`, naming the trigger ("Read this when ..."). CI fails if a module is unlisted or a listed module is missing.
3. One entry in `llms.txt`.

One module per bullet in the core index, in theme order. The index sits below the cap's cut-off, so a new module costs a line there and nothing from the instruction budget.

## Module format

```markdown
# Topic

Read this when <the exact trigger — a task type, not a technology fan club>.

<!-- Distilled from <sources>. -->

- <one rule per bullet, imperative, specific enough to act on>
```

- The trigger names what the agent can see at the start of the task: the kind of task, the files it touches, the command it is about to run. A module loads only when the agent decides to open it, so a trigger phrased around a concept the agent never names at that moment ("coupling", "a decision record") never fires. When a module gains a rule, re-read the trigger and widen it if the new rule fires on a task the trigger does not name.
- Every bullet states a decision, a threshold, or a boundary. "Be careful with X" is not a rule; "X is atomic — a read, then a decision, then a write loses to parallel requests" is.
- Every bullet carries its reason in a clause: the failure it prevents. A model generalizes from the reason to cases the rule never listed, and a rule without one is followed only where its words match.
- A prohibition names what to do instead, where an alternative exists: "never parse a completion with a regex; validate against a schema" steers, "never parse a completion with a regex" leaves the agent guessing.
- State the outcome and the check that proves it, not the procedure. Numbered steps belong only where the order itself matters; a step list for a task the model can plan narrows its search and reads as mechanical.
- One rule per bullet. A bullet that needs a third sentence to state its rule is two rules.
- Plain register, no emphasis. Current models follow system and project instructions closely, and CRITICAL, MUST or a line in capitals makes them over-apply that rule everywhere ([Claude prompting best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices)). Emphasis goes on one line at most, and only after the agent was seen skipping that line; emphasis spread over many lines marks none of them.
- No rule contradicts another, in its own module or elsewhere: a model given two conflicting rules follows one of them at random ([Claude Code memory docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)), and a model that follows instructions literally is hurt more ([GPT-5 prompting guide](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide)). Before adding a rule, search `rules/` and the core for rules it could collide with; where two apply to the same case, the narrower rule names the exception or the precedence itself.
- Cross-reference sibling modules inline as `` (`rules/<sibling>.md`) `` instead of repeating their content. Repeat a rule across modules only when its absence at that moment would cause the mistake, and say why it is repeated.
- Cite where non-obvious material came from in the HTML comment under the heading. Distil in your own words; do not paste licensed text. The comment is optional — a module written from first principles has nothing to cite; never invent a source to fill the slot.

Rule shapes that outperform prose — prefer them when the material allows:

- A correct/wrong pair with the failure mode named ("`==` on a token compiles and leaks timing — compare in constant time") beats an abstract warning.
- A numeric threshold beats an adjective: "nesting ≤ 2, function ≤ 50 lines" is enforceable; "keep it small" is not.
- Version-migration knowledge as old → new pairs (`protect --staged` → `git --pre-commit --staged`), not narrative history.
- Where a rule can be checked mechanically, name the command that checks it (a grep, a lint rule, a CI step) — a rule that ships its own enforcement stops being advisory.
- A module whose rules get over-applied ends with a `Not a violation — leave these alone:` block naming what looks like a breach of its own rules and is not. Over-application is a real failure mode with a real cost: an agent that deletes a deliberate duplicate, flattens a chosen register, or optimizes a path nobody waits on has followed the module and damaged the repository. The same line test admits each carve-out — would an agent get this wrong without it? A carve-out that merely restates the rule's scope does not earn a line.

## Stack-agnostic, and what that permits

The ruleset holds for any stack with nothing extra to install (README). It holds line by line: no rule applies to one framework, platform or tool only. Four tests decide it.

- The core `AGENTS.md` names a framework, library, or non-baseline CLI only inside an explicit presence check — "A secret scanner already installed (`gitleaks version` exits 0, or similar) →", "a commitlint config always wins". The assumable baseline is git and the OS shell; the core declares no OS as its default either, it matches whichever one the user is on.
- No module is gated on a framework, platform or tool. A rule that holds for one of them is rewritten as the invariant behind it and placed in the module that owns the concern, or left out.
- The trigger states exactly the scope the content delivers, never wider. A trigger naming three CI platforms over a body covering one, or ending "any framework" over library-specific bullets, is a defect: narrow the trigger or add the missing content. Name the primary technology and where the transfer stops — "The invariants hold for any relational database; the SQL examples use PostgreSQL syntax, and every major engine has the equivalent."
- A module carries no unmarked stack-specific rule. Where general advice needs a concrete API, either give it across ecosystems (`rules/crypto.md`, `rules/dependencies.md`) or state the invariant and leave the API to the reader's stack.

Never assume a path, file, or configuration belonging to another repository or one machine: "`x.txt` at the repo root" is a rule about someone else's project. Make it conditional or drop it.

## Style

Follow the repo's own `rules/markdown.md` — it applies to this repository first. Short, exact, no filler, no marketing adjectives, commands and paths verbatim.

## Before opening a PR

`python3 scripts/lint.py` runs every check in a few seconds — CI runs that same script, so nothing can pass here and fail there. `python3 scripts/install-hooks.py` installs it as a `pre-commit` hook once per clone; a machine without a Python interpreter skips the hook and relies on CI.

- `AGENTS.md` ≤ 200 lines above the module index, and ≤ 32 KiB as a whole file.
- No ellipsis glyph (U+2026) in any tracked Markdown file; three plain dots stand in for it.
- The core names no framework, library, or non-baseline CLI above the module index — a curated blocklist, so a tool name that belongs inside a presence check is added to the exception list in `scripts/lint.py`, never waved through.
- Modules name blocklisted stacks only on a line marked as an example or on a line that names two or more ecosystems side by side — the same curated-blocklist approach, applied to every line of `rules/`, triggers included, and to each module's entry in the core index and in `llms.txt`.
- Every `rules/*.md` appears in the On-demand module index of `AGENTS.md`, and every module referenced anywhere exists.
- Every module opens with its `Read this when` trigger line.
- `llms.txt` lists every module, carries no stale entry, and every file it links exists.
- Relative links resolve and code fences are balanced.
- The two plugin manifests agree with each other, and every plugin-root path the `SessionStart` hook reads still exists — a hook naming a file that moved loads nothing and says nothing.

Trigger-versus-content scope is not mechanically checkable — it is the reviewer's job. Read the trigger, then read the bullets, and ask what a reader on a different stack does with each one.

State in the PR which rule the change adds or removes and which mistake it prevents. A PR that adds a module without naming the mistake gets that question back.
