A ruleset written in the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) format, with shared rules for AI coding agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini, Cursor, plus optional rule modules in `rules/` that load on demand. Clone once, import it globally into every agent you use.

The always-loaded core covers: concise token-efficient communication, a coding discipline that stops at the first rung that holds (smallest correct diff, no speculative abstractions), a hard verification gate before any "done" claim, and a commit-proposal habit with no assistant traces. The procedure for larger work (assumptions, plans, the last pass before "done", debugging) loads from `rules/workflow.md` when the task calls for it, so the always-loaded part stays under 10 KB. On-demand modules in `rules/` extend it — commit messages that inherit the target repo's own convention, backend security, databases, caching, resilience, deployment and infrastructure definitions, payments, and more.

No hard dependencies and nothing tool-specific. The ruleset is framework- and project-agnostic — it holds for any stack and any of the four agents, with nothing extra to install.

## Repository layout

```text
AGENTS.md        # the core ruleset — always loaded, under 200 instruction lines and 32 KiB (CI-enforced)
rules/           # on-demand modules, read only when the task matches; rules/INDEX.md lists
                 # them with their triggers, and CI fails if a module there is missing
                 # or a module here is unlisted
README.md        # setup and optional tooling (this file)
llms.txt         # index of the core and every module for LLM consumption —
                 # CI keeps it two-way synced with rules/
hooks/           # plugin-hooks.json and load-core — the SessionStart hooks that print AGENTS.md
                 # into a Claude Code or Codex session when the repo is installed as a plugin,
                 # and guard and verify, the PreToolUse and Stop hooks that enforce what the
                 # core forbids outright; each ships as .sh (Claude Code) and .ps1 (Codex on Windows)
.claude-plugin/  # plugin.json and marketplace.json for the Claude Code plugin; Codex reads the
                 # marketplace too
.codex-plugin/   # plugin.json for the Codex plugin
gemini-extension.json  # the Gemini CLI extension: loads AGENTS.md as a context file, no hooks
qwen-extension.json    # the same for Qwen Code
scripts/         # lint.py — every gate above, run by CI and by the optional
                 # pre-commit hook that install-hooks.py sets up
evals/           # benchmark/ runs this ruleset and five other plugins on the same
                 # tasks (Benchmark below); tasks/ holds the trap tasks it scores
```

The core is self-sufficient. Agents read `rules/*.md` only when the task matches (editing Markdown, styling UI, a dedicated refactor, ...) and skip them if the clone can't be located — so importing the single `AGENTS.md` is always enough.

The 200-instruction cap is not cosmetic: frontier models follow roughly 150–200 instructions reliably (measured by [IFScale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11538)), and the agent's own system prompt already spends ~50 of them. Everything past that budget degrades adherence to the rules that matter. The file also stays under 32 KiB, the default `project_doc_max_bytes` past which Codex silently truncates project instructions.

## Prerequisites

- [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/installation/)
- [Qwen Code](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/quickstart/)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli)

- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/download)
- [opencode](https://opencode.ai/docs/)

## Install as a plugin

The plugin loads `AGENTS.md` at session start and adds the hooks that turn the rules an agent most often breaks into hard checks. Pick the plugin or the manual import, not both: both put the core in context twice.

| Agent | Install | Update | Uninstall |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add khasky/awesome-agents-md`, then `/plugin install awesome-agents-md@awesome-agents-md` | `/plugin marketplace update awesome-agents-md`, or turn on auto-update under `/plugin` → Marketplaces | `/plugin uninstall awesome-agents-md@awesome-agents-md` |
| Codex | `codex plugin marketplace add khasky/awesome-agents-md`, then `codex plugin add awesome-agents-md@awesome-agents-md` | `codex plugin marketplace upgrade awesome-agents-md`, then the `add` again | `codex plugin remove awesome-agents-md@awesome-agents-md` |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini extensions install https://github.com/khasky/awesome-agents-md` (add `--auto-update` to follow the repository) | `gemini extensions update awesome-agents-md` | `gemini extensions uninstall awesome-agents-md` |
| Qwen Code | `qwen extensions install https://github.com/khasky/awesome-agents-md` | `qwen extensions update awesome-agents-md` | `qwen extensions uninstall awesome-agents-md` |

What the hooks do:

- `guard` (before every shell command) blocks printing the environment or a secret variable, and a commit carrying a `Co-Authored-By` or session trailer. When you do want one of these, run it yourself in a terminal. A `git commit`, a force-push and a skip of git hooks (`--no-verify`, a `core.hooksPath` override) it hands to you to approve or reject, and so are the destructive commands nothing restores: a recursive delete of `/`, `~`, `.` or `.git`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`, `DROP`/`TRUNCATE` or `DELETE` without `WHERE`, and a downloaded script piped into a shell.
- `shape` (after a file is written or edited) adds one line in the flow of the work: a source file just created is kept under 60 lines unless the request names more and proved with one run; a code edit in a repository with tests is proved with them, named with a command that runs there.
- `facts` (at session start) states how the repository's tests run here and, on Windows, which syntax each shell tool takes, so no command fails once to find out.
- `verify` (when the agent finishes) sends it back once, for the first of: an assistant trailer in its reply; an edit to code no command followed.
- `remind` (with every prompt) adds one line: answer in at most 35 words unless an explanation is asked for. Length is held by this line, not by sending an answer back, so no answer is paid for twice.

Codex runs the hooks only after you trust them: the next interactive `codex` start lists them under "Hooks need review". Codex passes no session transcript to the `Stop` hook, so `verify` does nothing there. Gemini CLI and Qwen Code get the core only, without hooks.

Every other agent takes the manual import below. GitHub Copilot CLI installs the plugin, but it reads only a JSON `additionalContext` from a session-start hook and `load-core` prints plain text, so the core would not reach the session. Antigravity CLI installs the repository from a clone (`agy plugin install <clone>` reads `gemini-extension.json`), but loads nothing from it: no context file, no hooks. Its own plugin format would read `rules/` as always-on rules, so it is not offered. Cursor's Agent Plugins format carries only skills and MCP servers. Kilo Code's plugins are npm code modules.

## Install manually (import)

Clone the repository once:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/khasky/awesome-agents-md.git
```

Then add one import line to the agent's global instructions file (create it if it does not exist). The examples assume the clone is at `C:\repos\awesome-agents-md`; on macOS or Linux use `~/.claude/...` and your own path.

| Agent | File | Line |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\CLAUDE.md` | `@C:/repos/awesome-agents-md/AGENTS.md` |
| Codex | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\AGENTS.md` | `@C:/repos/awesome-agents-md/AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\GEMINI.md` | `@C:/repos/awesome-agents-md/AGENTS.md` |
| Qwen Code | `%USERPROFILE%\.qwen\QWEN.md` | `@C:/repos/awesome-agents-md/AGENTS.md` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\copilot-instructions.md` | paste the contents of `AGENTS.md` |
| Antigravity | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\AGENTS.md` | paste the contents of `AGENTS.md` |
| opencode | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\AGENTS.md` | paste the contents of `AGENTS.md` |
| Kilo Code CLI | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\kilo\kilo.jsonc` | `"instructions": ["C:/repos/awesome-agents-md/AGENTS.md"]` |
| Cursor | Settings → Rules → User Rules | paste the contents of `AGENTS.md` |
| Windsurf | per project only: `AGENTS.md` in the repository root | copy the file |

- Claude Code, Gemini CLI and Qwen Code resolve the `@` import themselves; Claude Code asks once to approve it. Kilo Code reads the file named in `instructions`, so it follows `git pull` too.
- Copilot CLI expands `@` only for files inside its own instructions folder, so it takes the pasted text. Antigravity also reads `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`: with the Gemini CLI line in place, skip its row, or the core loads twice.
- Windsurf caps global rules at 6,000 characters and `AGENTS.md` is longer, so it goes into each project instead.
- A pasted copy does not follow `git pull`: paste again after an update.
- Codex has no import syntax: it reads the `@` line as text and follows it. For guaranteed loading, paste the file itself (Codex reads up to 32 KiB of instructions).
- Per project instead of globally: copy `AGENTS.md` into the repository root. For Gemini CLI, add `"contextFileName": ["GEMINI.md", "AGENTS.md"]` to `~/.gemini/settings.json`.
- Never copy `rules/` into `.claude/rules/`: Claude Code loads every file there at session start, which turns the on-demand modules into always-on tokens.
- The import gets no hooks. In Claude Code, `"attribution": { "commit": "", "pr": "" }` in `settings.json` stops the default commit trailer.
- Update with `git pull` in the clone; uninstall by deleting the line.

## How modules load

Nothing loads a module automatically. The core points at `rules/INDEX.md`, one line per module naming the task that should open it; the agent reads the index when a task leaves the core, then the module whose line matches. The index stays out of the always-loaded core, so a turn that needs no module does not pay for it. Loading is therefore the agent's judgment call, the same as any other instruction it follows. To check that a module was read, ask the agent which `rules/` files it opened for the task, or watch for the file read in the tool log.

Conflicts resolve in a fixed order: the user's message, then the nearest project `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, then this core and the modules it indexes.

## Checking that it loaded

In Claude Code, `/context` shows the core in the session and how many tokens it takes, and `/doctor` suggests trims. In any agent, prompt "Summarize the instructions you loaded"; to check that the whole file arrived, ask about a rule near its end, such as the Commits section. If a specific rule keeps being ignored, the usual cause is file length: prune before rephrasing.

## Benchmark

Claude Code 2.1.289 runs the same seeded tasks with no plugin (baseline), with this ruleset, and with [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman), [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail), [i-have-adhd](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd), [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) and [andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills), one plugin per session, the latest model of each tier at `--effort low`, 5 attempts per task. A script scores what each session leaves behind: trap tasks where the tempting move is the wrong one, source lines written for open requests, words in the final answer, and cost.

† superpowers on `claude-haiku-4-5` stopped to ask clarifying questions on most open requests (20 of 25 sessions wrote no code), so its line count is not comparable and is not ranked.

Reproduce (run results stay outside the checkout):

```bash
python evals/benchmark/run.py --selftest                     # every scorer tells good from bad, no agent
python evals/benchmark/run.py --split test --repeats 5 --model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort low --budget 30
python evals/benchmark/run.py --summary <run directory>      # totals with 95% intervals

Companion repositories, each a separate layer; pick the ones you need:

- **Awesome Agents MD** — *this repo:* the base, tool-agnostic ruleset every agent imports (one `AGENTS.md`). Start here; the layers below are optional on top.
- [Awesome Agent Skills](https://github.com/khasky/awesome-agent-skills) — portable `SKILL.md` skills every agent loads: code review, debugging, security and leak audits, code and text cleanup.
- [Agent MCP Integrations](https://github.com/khasky/agent-mcp-integrations) — MCP servers that connect agents to browsers, cloud, databases, infra, and domain APIs.
- [Claude Code Token Optimization](https://github.com/khasky/claude-code-token-optimization) — the token-efficiency layer (LSP, `codebase-memory-mcp`, ast-grep, Context7, Caveman, Ponytail).
- [Claude Code Security Audit](https://github.com/khasky/claude-code-security-audit) — the layered security-audit workflow (deep audit, continuous guardrails, scanners).

**A rule or a skill?** A rule is a standing constraint the agent honors without being asked; a skill is a procedure you invoke, with phases and an output contract. The two layers overlap: `rules/code-review.md` here sets the bar every review must meet, and the `awesome-code-review` skill runs the review and produces the report. Install both — rules keep everyday work in line, skills handle the jobs you name.

## Contributing

A rule earns its line only if an agent would get it wrong without it, and the core `AGENTS.md` stays under 200 instruction lines and 32 KiB — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the format of a new `rules/` module and the checks CI runs.
